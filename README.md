# Underworld_ice_stream_formation_and_Mechanical_anisotropy
Code for the revising manuscript, Zhang et al., How to make an ice stream by crystal-lattice rotation only
We perform several model runs up to 4000â€“5000 years to explore the effect of varying boundary conditions, such as no or free slip at the ice base, symmetry or asymmetry of inflow from the sides, and varying anisotropies. 
Note in the code: the z-axis is the horizontal inflow direction; the x-axis is the horizontal outflow direction; and the y-axis is the vertical direction.

Model 1: isotropic ice, symmetric inflow, no-slip basal boundary
Model 2: anisotropic ice (10), symmetric inflow, no-slip basal boundary
Model 3: anisotropic ice (10), asymmetric inflow, no slip 
Model 4: anisotropic ice (100), asymmetric inflow, no slip
Model 5: anisotropic ice (10), symmetric inflow, free slip 
Model 6: anisotropic ice (10), asymmetric inflow, free slip 
Model 7: anisotropic ice (100), symmetric inflow, free slip 
model 8: isotropic ice, symmetric inflow, free slip
Model Test: based on Model 3, but with more particles per mesh
